# R-solutions-AndrewNg-MachineLearning-Class
THis repository contains the solution to Andrew Ng class on Machine Learning ,conducted by cousera. Though the class focussed on Octave,
R is even a great way to solve the problems. I have written R codes to minimize cost function using gradient descent optimization techniques.
